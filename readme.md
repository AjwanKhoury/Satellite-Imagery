Star Tracker Program using Machine Learning
GitHub stars GitHub last commit GitHub license

Welcome to the Star Tracker program! This repository contains a star tracking application that utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and track stars in astronomical images. With this program, you can identify and monitor celestial objects with greater accuracy and efficiency.

Features
Star Detection: The program employs advanced machine learning algorithms to detect stars in astronomical images. It leverages the power of computer vision to locate and classify stars accurately, even in noisy or crowded images.

Tracking and Cataloging: Once the stars are detected, the program tracks their positions over time. It provides detailed information about each star, such as its coordinates, magnitude, and any associated data from existing astronomical catalogs.

Data Visualization: The program visualizes the tracked star positions on celestial maps, enabling you to explore the distribution of stars and study their movements. It also generates plots and graphs to visualize various properties and trends in the data.

Customizability: The program offers various parameters and settings that you can adjust to suit your specific needs. You can fine-tune the detection thresholds, customize the visualization options, and incorporate additional algorithms or techniques as required.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd repo-name
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your astronomical images in a compatible format (e.g., FITS, JPEG, PNG).

Run the star tracking program:

css
Copy code
python star_tracker.py --input <path_to_images_directory>
Replace <path_to_images_directory> with the path to the directory containing your astronomical images.

Explore the results! The program will generate visualizations, reports, and any other specified outputs in the program's configuration.

Configuration
You can customize the program's behavior and settings by modifying the config.yaml file. This file allows you to specify parameters such as detection thresholds, visualization options, and file output formats.
